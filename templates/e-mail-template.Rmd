Hi `r params$first`,


According to 
[https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos) 
you have signed up to give an online teaching demo on `r params$date_string` 
(See this link for your local time: [`r params$tzconvert_url`](`r params$tzconvert_url`)). 
I will be the Instructor Trainer running the session.

Please be prepared to teach for 5 minutes, beginning at the start of your 
chosen **episode** from a Carpentries lesson. Please review the page on 
[Suggested Lessons for Teaching Demonstrations](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demo_lessons) 
to ensure that your selection is on the list.

`r params$snippet`

Please remember - this is _not_ a high stakes test! This is a friendly 
opportunity to give and receive feedback on a more polished presentation style. 
In the event that I ask you to repeat your demo, I will provide this 
information with clear instructions on what to change in an email to you after 
the demo. You will only receive qualitative feedback publicly during the demo, 
not information regarding whether this checkout step is considered complete.

See you at the demo session,
