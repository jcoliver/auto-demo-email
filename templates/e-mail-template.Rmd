Hi `r params$first`,


According to 
[https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos) 
you have signed up to give an online teaching demo on `r params$date_string` 
(See this link for your local time: [`r params$tzconvert_url`](`r params$tzconvert_url`)). 
I will be the Instructor Trainer running the session.

Please be prepared to teach for 5 minutes, beginning at the start of your 
chosen **episode** from a Carpentries lesson. Please review the page on 
[Suggested Lessons for Teaching Demonstrations](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demo_lessons) 
to ensure that your selection is on the list.

`r params$snippet`

Please visit the Etherpad 
[https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos) 
a few minutes before the demo starts.

See you at the demo session,
